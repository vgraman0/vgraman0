# Vishal Raman

**`Software Engineer | Technical Writer | Lifelong Learner`**

I'm a software engineer at IMC Trading on the Valuation team for FICC/Index, working on volatility modeling, rates modeling, and early exercise pricing. UC Berkeley alum with a deep love for mathematics. I spend my time building projects across distributed systems, deep learning, and agentic AI — and writing about what I learn along the way on my [blog](https://vgraman0.github.io).

   <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Journey</h3></summary>
   I came out of UC Berkeley with a heavy math background — I once took 10 math courses in a single semester. That led me to IMC Trading in Chicago, where I joined the Valuation team building pricing tools for fixed income and index products. After hitting my stride there, I took on managing interns and discovered a real passion for mentoring and clear technical communication. Mid-2025, I made the leap to relocate to IMC's Mumbai office to push myself into new challenges and expanded responsibilities. Along the way, I shifted from passively consuming courses to actively building — making 3-4 project prototypes every few months, writing technical blog posts, and working toward launching a product to real users. The goal isn't just to learn; it's to build things that matter.
